# Pragma Brewery System

This a programatic test from PragmaTeam about Shane, a driver Micro Brewery.

## To Run
### Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

Or just `Yarn`

### Run localy with you console

```
npm start
```

Or 
```
yarn start
```

This project use a simple `console.log` operation to show the state from each Beer that Shane is delivering with his truck.

The file `random-thermostat.js` is a example of a good point that can be change in the future with a new version of this system. I am imagining in a real scenary we can have a fisical sessor and one interface to get the real temperature from ther beers. This random function is just one test to get different results and situations in the test scenary.

## TODO
1 - Have to have an user interface for this solution? Maybe for a future version, for now we can work with 'console logs'.

2 - It's a server-side or client-side application? For now, we can use a simple JavaScript index file that can be running with a Node.js or with a HTML file.

3 - For the version 2.0, we can have a real phisical sensor that will return the real temperatures.

4 - For the version 2.0, we can show diferent messages and colors if the temperature is above or below ideal.
